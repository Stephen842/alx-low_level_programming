in this files i will be workimg on the topic bit manipulation
such as
writing a function that convert a binary number to an unsigned interger
writing a function that gives the binary form of any number
writing a function that returns the value of a bit
writitng a function that set the values of a bit to 1 in a given index
writitng a function that set the values of a bit to 0 in a given index
writing a function that gives the number of bit you would need to swap from one number to another
writing a function that checks for endianess (refers to the way in which multi-byte data types (such as integers and floating-point numbers) are stored in memory.).
